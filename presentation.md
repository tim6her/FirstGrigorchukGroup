# Bounded Burnside's Problem


## Periodic Groups

### Definition
A group $G$ is called *periodic* if for each element $a \in G$ there exists an integer $n > 0$ such that
$$a^n = e.$$

. . .

### Examples
 * Every finite group is periodic.
 * The group of bijective mappings from $\N$ onto $\N$ is periodic.


## Groups with Exponent

### Definition
If there exists a positive integer $N$, such that
$$a^N = e$$
for all elements $a$ of a group $G$, we say $G$ *is of exponent* $N$.

. . .

### Example
Let $\F_2$ be the field of order 2. Then the polynomials $\mathbb F_2[X]$ over $(\F_2, +)$ form a group of exponent $2$.

## Bounded Burnsides Problem
> A still undecided problem in the theory of discontinuous groups is whether the order of a group may be not finite while the order of every operation it contains is finite.  
> -- Burnside 1902

. . .

### Bounded Burnside Problem
Is every finitely generated, periodic group finite?
